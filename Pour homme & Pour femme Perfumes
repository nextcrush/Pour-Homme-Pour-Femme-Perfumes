In French “Pour” means “for” in English and “Homme” stands for “man”. You will never see any ending to womens perfumes because they are the original fragrance. But when you see “pour home” added in the names of any perfume it means a new version for men. 
Similarly “Femme” in French is used for “Woman” hence you may see some perfumes made for women are ending with term “Pour Femme”. Now don’t be confused whether perfume is for men or women while shopping online as sometimes it is not mentioned separately.
woody, musky, aromatic, strong and leathery Perfumes are considered to be for men  perfumes. Floral, fresh, fruity, sweet and light fragrances are usually considered to be for women. This is normally how mens and womens perfumes are differentiated.
